The some functionality between [Yathit Chrome Extension](https://www.yathit.com/sugarcrm-gmail.html) and [Yathit Gmail Addon](https://www.yathit.com/sugarcrm-gmail-addon.html) are overlapped, but they are completely separate products developed by different technology stack. Yathit is committed to support both products.

Gmail Addon is build using [Google App Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) and run on Google server. Chrome Extension is run on your browser using standard HTML, CSS and Javascript. Chrome Extension enhance Gmail UI and often have to hack into it and sometimes unreliable. Gmail Addon is reliable but slow due to running on server side. Gmail Addon cannot interface with Gmail UI and only show on message view.
