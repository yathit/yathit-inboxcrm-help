## Archive message content

SugarCRM can save email messages in three formats: save only email content, save the whole email content, or just the visible content viewable in your Gmail.

Email messages are saved on SugarCRM as HTML email version and only text version. If you want to save only the text version, then select the “Text only” option. Selecting the “Text only” option will save space on the server.

## Outgoing email archive preference

Being configurable, all your outgoing email messages from your browser are saved in the SugarCRM. To get this done, select the “always archived” option.

You can select the “archived normally” option if you want to save all your outgoing emails in SugarCRM. If you don't want to archive all emails, then uncheck the “archive” option in the message toolbar. The opposite of this option is “not archived normally,” which means your outgoing emails will not be saved in the SugarCRM.

The default setting option is “enabled for archiving”. With this option activated, your previous email archive selection will become active.

For those who do not want to use the archive feature can select the “disabled for archive” option.

## Relationship record suggestion

With the {{ site.product }}, , you can add the accounts record as a relationship along with your emails for the Contacts (email recipients). The options available are:

* linked to the archived email
