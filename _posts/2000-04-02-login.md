Yathit browser extension works even without login to Yathit server, however to persist setting and additional features for licensing, you should log in to Yathit server. 

In the Yathit sidebar, go to about page, {{ "ydn-logo-bw" | svg_icon }}. If you are not login, you should see "Login to Yathit server" link, as shown below.

## Using Extension in multiple Gmail accounts

By default only one Gmail account will use Extension. On other Gmail session, the extension will be hidden on side. If you want to use all Gmail accounts, you can do so by setup the related configuration in General Preference Setting page:

{% include full-screenshot.html file="enable-all-gmail-sessions.gif" %}
