## Enterprise licensing 

Any Google domain admin or a person who has access to the Admin Directory API can easily manage not only the bill payments but also the usage auditing as well. To do this, login to the [Yathit Admin Portal](https://www.yathit.com/portal/crm-admin.html). 

Note that the user has to be either a Google domain admin or someone who has access to the Admin Directory API. You do not have to use any special [Google apps integration, Google apps integration] for using the Admin portal or to manage the users.
