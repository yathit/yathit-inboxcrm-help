## Do-not-track

Yathit server also has a unique feature. With this feature, if you are receiving a signal from a website and if you do not want to track that person, you can do so by entering his/ her email address in the do-not-track members list. On tracking, the beacon slips the members list, even if you select the address for tracking. With this feature, any email address from the list is ignored. However, any existing signal that is found has to be deleted manually.
