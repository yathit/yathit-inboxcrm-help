Yathit Browser Extension provides you an option to easily keep a track on:

1. Who is opening the email you have sent, 
2. When the email has been opened, 
3. Where the email has been opened, and 
4. If the links embedded in the email are clicked. 

Let us see how it works.

## How to track an email

To track an outbound email, select the *Track* checkbox when compose or reply a message: 

{% include full-screenshot.html file="sending-tracked-email.png" %}
<br/>

The main advantage of this feature is that the person who receives the email will never know or feel about the email tracking.

For more detail see [How email tracking works](how-email-tracking-work.html). 

## Tracking links

Link tracking is very easy with Yathit. When use embedded links within your email, and the recipient clicks on any of them, you will be aware of all such actions as well.

To ensure that the link tracking is enabled in your email, select the Tracking check box before sending the email. 

All hyperlink embedded in your email will be tracked automatically.

## Get notified

Yathit will send you a notification when the recipient opens the email or clicks any embedded link.

The “get notification” feature provides you real-time notification in Google Chrome browser as soon as the recipient opens a *recently* tracked email or clicks the link.

## Easy to view tracking

To see the status of your tracked message, just look beside the Gmail message thread.
